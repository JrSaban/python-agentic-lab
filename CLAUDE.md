# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project overview

FastAPI To-Do List API built with a Clean Architecture layering, used as a learning project: the author is an experienced PHP/Laravel developer learning Python/FastAPI/SQLAlchemy by building it. Python 3.12, managed with `uv`. PostgreSQL is the database; Redis holds the category cache, the refresh tokens and the rate-limit counters.

Language conventions, all deliberate:

- Module-level docstrings (top of file) and API error messages (`detail`) are in **French**. Several module docstrings carry a Laravel analogy ("Équivalent conceptuel de ... dans Laravel") — keep them, and add one when a new cross-cutting piece has an obvious Laravel counterpart.
- Function, method and class docstrings are in **English**. Many existing ones are still in French from before this rule.
- Test docstrings, `CLAUDE.md`, `README.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` are in English.

Branch names, commit messages and PR rules live in `CONTRIBUTING.md`; the PR template is `.github/pull_request_template.md` (Why / Changes / Notes). Planned work is in `ROADMAP.md`: an item is removed from it in the same PR that finishes it.

## Commands

Everything runs through `uv run`.

```bash
docker compose up -d --build            # API on :8000 (hot-reload on ./src) + Postgres :5432 + Redis :6379
uv run uvicorn src.main:app --reload    # API on the host, against the compose Postgres/Redis

uv run pytest                                  # full suite
uv run pytest tests/unit/                      # unit tests only
uv run pytest tests/test_todos.py::test_name   # one test

uv run ruff check --fix . && uv run ruff format .

uv run alembic revision --autogenerate -m "description"
uv run alembic upgrade head
```

### Environment

`.env` targets a host-run API (`POSTGRES_HOST=localhost`, `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0`). `docker-compose.yml` overrides `DATABASE_URL` and `REDIS_URL` for the `api` container so they point at the `db`/`redis` service names — a new connection setting needs both places.

`Settings` refuses to start if `JWT_SECRET_KEY` is shorter than 32 bytes or starts with `change-me`, which is exactly what `.env.example` ships. A fresh `cp .env.example .env` therefore crashes at import time until a real secret is set (`openssl rand -hex 32`). Anything that imports `src.core.config` needs the variable, including Alembic — which is why the CI `migrations` job sets it.

### CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs four independent jobs on every push and PR: `lint`, `format` (`ruff format --check`), `test`, and `migrations` (`alembic upgrade head` against a real Postgres service). The `migrations` job is the only place the migrations themselves, and the Postgres dialect in general, are exercised — the test suite runs on SQLite with `Base.metadata.create_all`, never through Alembic. A fifth job, `docker`, pushes `ghcr.io/<repo>:latest` on pushes to `main` once the other four pass.

### Migrations

`alembic/env.py` imports every module's `models.py` explicitly so autogenerate can see all tables — a new module's models must be added there too. Alembic's default template is not Ruff-compliant (imports, `Union[...]` hints): fix the generated file to match the existing ones in `alembic/versions/`. Review what autogenerate emits for functional indexes (see "Uniqueness" below): the existing migrations declare them by hand with `sa.literal_column("lower(name)")`.

## Tests

Integration tests (`tests/test_*.py`) go through the full FastAPI stack with the `client` fixture, which overrides two dependencies: `get_db_session` (in-memory SQLite via `aiosqlite`, tables created and dropped around every test) and `get_redis_client` (a per-test `fakeredis.FakeAsyncRedis`, exposed as the `redis_client` fixture so a test can inspect or seed keys directly). The rate-limit middleware calls `get_redis_client()` itself, outside dependency injection, so `dependency_overrides` doesn't reach it: the `client` fixture also monkeypatches `src.core.redis.redis_client` with the same fake. Every test starts with an empty fake, hence fresh rate-limit counters. Unit tests (`tests/unit/`) isolate one `*Service` by passing `AsyncMock` for its repositories and its Redis client; the module-level functions of `src/core/security.py` are called directly by services rather than injected, so they are patched at the import site: `@patch("src.modules.<module>.service.<function_name>")`.

Which kind to write:

- Real SQL logic (filters, joins) → integration test. Mocking the repository proves nothing about the query.
- Service branching/orchestration, and failure modes that `fakeredis` can't produce (`RedisError`, corrupted cache payload) → unit test with `side_effect`.
- Cache behaviour (stored, served, invalidated) → integration test with `redis_client`. The "served from cache" tests prove a hit by inserting a row through the repository directly, which bypasses the service's invalidation, then asserting the API still returns the old result.

`conftest.py` force-sets `JWT_SECRET_KEY` with `os.environ[...]` but `DEBUG` with `os.environ.setdefault` right above it, both before any `src.*` import. The difference is deliberate, not an inconsistency to fix: tests must never depend on the secret in a developer's `.env`, while `DEBUG` may be turned on from the shell to see logs.

### Auth fixtures

`current_user`/`authenticated_client` (plain user) and `current_admin_user`/`authenticated_admin` (admin) create the `User` row directly through `UserRepository` and override `get_current_user` with `lambda: user`, so no JWT is involved. This is the default for permission-matrix tests. Only `test_get_me_with_real_token`/`test_get_me_without_token_returns_401` in `tests/test_users.py` send a real `Authorization: Bearer` header obtained from a real login, to prove the JWT/dependency wiring end to end. `tests/test_auth.py` uses real registration + `/login` for the refresh-token flows, because those need tokens actually issued into Redis.

`authenticated_client` and `authenticated_admin` return the *same* `client` object: the override is a single entry in `app.dependency_overrides`, not a property of the client. Requesting both in one test does not give two identities — whichever fixture is set up last (parameter order in the test signature) wins for the whole test. A test that needs a second user takes the `other_user` fixture, a plain `User` row with no client attached, and creates that user's data through the repository (`TodoRepository(db_session).create(owner_id=other_user.id, ...)`), never through the API.

`test_create_category_concurrent_same_name_no_duplicate` is the model for race-condition tests: it bypasses the HTTP layer, opens two independent sessions from `test_session_factory`, calls the service in both under `asyncio.gather`, and checks the row count from a third session.

## Architecture

### Module layering

Each domain lives under `src/modules/<name>/`, in strict call order:

```
router.py → service.py → repository.py → models.py
```

- **`repository.py`** — the only layer that builds or executes SQL. Takes and returns ORM instances or primitives, never raises HTTP-flavoured errors, imports schemas only to type its inputs (`*Create`/`*Update`). Lets `IntegrityError` propagate.
- **`service.py`** — business and orchestration logic: permissions, resolving foreign IDs into objects, deciding what to eager-load, translating `IntegrityError`, caching. May depend on another module's repository (`TodoService` takes a `CategoryRepository` to resolve `category_ids`; `AuthService` takes a `UserRepository`). Raises the exceptions from `src/core/exceptions.py`, never `fastapi.HTTPException`.
- **`router.py`** — endpoints, the `get_<name>_service` factory and the `*ServiceDep` alias. Request validation and response serialization happen here. Convention: in a handler signature the injected service comes **before** `current_user`, path params and the request body.

Services return ORM models and the router serializes them through `response_model`. The one deliberate exception is the cached read path of `CategoryService` (`list_categories`, `get_category_cached`), which returns `CategoryResponse` objects: a cache hit yields JSON, and an ORM instance can't be rebuilt from it, so both the hit and the miss path return the schema to keep one return type. Don't generalize this to uncached services.

`auth` has no `models.py`/`repository.py` (it owns no table), and `todos_categories` holds only the association `Table`.

`src/core/` is what every module shares:

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `database.py` | Async engine, `Base` (declares `id` — no model repeats it), `get_db_session`: **one transaction per request**, committed after the handler returns, rolled back on any exception. Repositories only `flush()`. |
| `config.py` | `pydantic-settings`, reads `.env`. |
| `exceptions.py` | `AppBaseError` and its subclasses, generic rather than per-resource, each carrying its `status_code`. A single `@app.exception_handler(AppBaseError)` in `main.py` handles them all, so a new error type is just a subclass with a `status_code`. |
| `repository.py` | `BaseRepository` (below). |
| `schemas.py` | `PaginatedResponse[T]` and `LimitQuery`. |
| `security.py` | Argon2 password hashing, JWT access tokens, refresh-token generation and hashing. |
| `redis.py` | The shared async client (`decode_responses=True`, so values come back as `str`), the `get_redis_client` dependency, and `hash_redis_key`. |
| `logging.py` | `structlog` setup. |
| `rate_limit.py` | `is_rate_limited` / `increment_rate_limit`, the Redis counters behind every rate limit (see below). |

### Generic repository layer

`BaseRepository[ModelT: Base]` provides `get_by_id`, `update`, `delete`, `paginate` and `count_query` — the parts that are genuinely identical across resources. Its `get_by_id` and `delete` know nothing about soft deletes (`delete` is a real `DELETE`); `TodoRepository` and `CategoryRepository` override both.

`TodoRepository` keeps its own `get_by_id`/`update` (`# pyrefly: ignore[bad-override]`), because `owner_id`/`categories` are required parameters the shared signature can't express without weakening the "no default" guarantee described under Ownership. This divergence is deliberate, not a gap to unify.

`get_all`/`count` stay per-repository, and both go through that repository's private `_apply_filters`, so the page and its total can never drift apart. Plain equality and partial-match filters are passed to `BaseRepository._apply_filter_params` as a `list[FilterParams]` (`NamedTuple(column, value, op: Literal["eq", "ilike"])`) — named and typed, never a dict. Filters that don't fit (`Todo.category_ids` via `.any()`, `User.name` across two columns) are written by hand next to it.

### Uniqueness and race conditions

`Category.name`, `User.email` and `User.pseudo` are unique **case-insensitively**, enforced by functional unique indexes (`uq_partial_categories_name_lower`, `uq_users_email_lower`, `uq_users_pseudo_lower`, all on `lower(column)`), not by a `SELECT` before the `INSERT`. Services deliberately do no pre-check: two concurrent requests would both pass it. They call the repository, catch `IntegrityError`, and raise `ConflictError`.

Consequences to keep in mind:

- `UserService` has two unique columns, so it tells them apart by looking for the **index name** inside `str(e)` and re-raises anything it doesn't recognize. The index names are therefore part of the logic: renaming one in the model without updating the service turns a 409 into an unhandled 500. Both Postgres and SQLite include the index name in the error message, which is what lets the SQLite suite cover this.
- A new unique column follows the same pattern: named functional index in `__table_args__`, hand-checked migration, `IntegrityError` → `ConflictError` in the service, and a `..._with_unrelated_integrity_error_reraises` style unit test.
- The plain `index=True` on those columns is kept alongside the unique one for `ilike` filtering.
- The category index is **partial** (`WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`): a name is unique among live categories only, so the name of a soft-deleted category can be reused by a create or a rename. The model declares both `postgresql_where` and `sqlite_where`; dropping the second would make the SQLite test suite enforce a stricter rule than production.

### Soft deletes

`Todo` and `Category` carry a nullable `deleted_at`; their repositories override `delete()` to set it instead of removing the row. `User` has no soft delete and no delete endpoint — an account is switched off through `is_active`.

There is **no global scope**, unlike Laravel's `SoftDeletes` trait: every query on these two models filters `deleted_at IS NULL` by hand, and a new query must do the same. That includes queries going *through* the relationship (`selectinload`, `.any()`): a soft delete leaves the `todos_categories` rows in place, so the other side has to be filtered too.

A deleted row behaves exactly like a missing one, for admins as well: 404 on `GET`/`PATCH`/`DELETE`, absent from lists and totals, silently dropped when its ID is sent in a todo's `category_ids`. There is no restore endpoint and no way to list deleted rows.

### Authentication

`users` owns the `User` resource; `auth` owns authentication (`POST /login`, `/refresh`, `/logout`, and `get_current_user`).

**Access token** — a JWT whose payload is only `{"sub": str(user.id), "exp": ...}`, valid 5 minutes. `is_admin`/`is_active` are never baked in: `get_current_user` (exposed as `CurrentUserDep`, imported by every other router) re-fetches the `User` on each request and rejects inactive users, so a role change or deactivation applies immediately. The scheme is `HTTPBearer`, not `OAuth2PasswordBearer`: login takes a JSON body (`LoginRequest`), not the OAuth2 form.

**Login takes the same time whether the email exists or not.** `AuthService.login` always runs `verify_password`, against `_DUMMY_PASSWORD_HASH` (a real Argon2 hash computed once at import) when the email is unknown — so response time can't be used to enumerate registered emails.

**Refresh token** — an opaque random string (`secrets.token_urlsafe`), not a JWT, valid `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` and rotated on every use. Redis only ever stores its SHA-256, under three keys:

```
refresh_token:token:<sha256>          → user_id     # lookup on /refresh
refresh_token:user:<user_id>          → <sha256>    # find and revoke the user's current token
refresh_token:session_start:<user_id> → timestamp   # when this session began; set at login only
```

The first two share the sliding `REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRE_DAYS` TTL, reset on every login and refresh.
`session_start` uses its own, longer `REFRESH_TOKEN_ABSOLUTE_MAX_DAYS` TTL and is written only by
`login()` — `refresh()` never touches it.

Rules, all deliberate:

- **One refresh token per user.** Logging in again replaces the previous one, so a second device logs the first one out at its next refresh.
- **Rotation on every `/refresh`.** The presented token is consumed with `GETDEL`, so two concurrent refreshes with the same token can't both succeed, and a new pair is issued.
- **An absolute session lifetime independent of activity.** Rotation alone would let a session renew itself forever as long as the user stays active. `session_start` closes that: checked right after the token lookup and before the DB call, it rejects with the same 401 once it's gone, regardless of how valid the presented token otherwise is.
- **No reuse detection.** Replaying a rotated token just returns 401; it does not revoke the current one.
- `/refresh` re-checks that the user still exists and is active, and returns the same 401 message for every failure.
- `/logout` requires a valid access token and deletes all three keys.
- **Changing your password revokes the session too.** `PATCH /users/me/password` calls `revoke_session`, once the password update succeeds.
- SHA-256 rather than Argon2 because the token is high-entropy and must be looked up by its hash. `hash_redis_key` (MD5) is a different thing: it only shortens cache keys and has no security role.

**Roles** — `is_admin`/`is_active` are not settable through `PATCH /users/{id}` (`UserUpdate` has no such fields; Pydantic drops them silently). They change only through `PATCH /users/{id}/active` and `.../admin`, both admin-only and backed by dedicated repository methods (`set_active`/`set_admin`). Both refuse to deactivate or demote the last usable admin, counted as `count(is_admin=True, is_active=True) == 1` — the `is_active=True` part matters, otherwise already-deactivated admins would be counted as available.

**Email** is excluded from `UserUpdate` the same way, for the same reason: changing it is sensitive enough to need its own gate. `PATCH /users/me/email` requires the current password; `PATCH /users/{id}/email` is admin-only and 403s on the admin's own id, forcing them through the password-gated route for themselves too. Both revoke the target's session via `AuthService.revoke_session`.

### Ownership & permissions

`Todo.owner_id` and `Category.created_by_id` are named differently on purpose: the two resources treat their user differently.

**Todos are private.** `TodoRepository.get_all`/`get_by_id`/`count` take an `owner_id: int | None` filter; `TodoService` computes it as `current_user.id`, or `None` for an admin, which disables the filter. Ownership is enforced in one place, the repository's `WHERE`. Requesting someone else's todo therefore raises `NotFoundError`, never `ForbiddenError`: the row simply doesn't match, and a 403 would reveal that the ID exists. `get_by_id`'s `owner_id` is keyword-only with no default because it sits next to `entity_id`, another `int` — a positional call could swap them unnoticed, and a default would let a caller inherit an unfiltered query by accident.

**Categories are shared.** Every authenticated user can list, read and create them; `created_by_id` gates mutation only. `update_category` requires admin or creator; `delete_category` requires admin — the creator cannot delete their own category. The checks are ordered differently on purpose: `update_category` fetches the row first because it needs `created_by_id` to decide, while `delete_category` checks `is_admin` before touching the repository, since the answer doesn't depend on the row (same order as `UserService.set_user_active`/`set_user_admin`).

`owner_id`/`created_by_id` are never read from the request body. They are passed to `repository.create(...)` as a separate keyword argument taken from `current_user.id`, like `hashed_password` in `UserRepository.create`.

`CategoryService.list_categories`, `get_category_cached` and `get_category_or_404` take no `current_user`. `CurrentUserDep` on `GET /categories` and `GET /categories/{id}` is thus a router-only guard with nothing behind it: on `todos`, removing it would break the `owner_id` computation immediately, but here the endpoint would silently become public. That is why `tests/test_categories.py` has explicit "no token → 401" tests for list/get and `tests/test_todos.py` doesn't need them.

Responses are never filtered field by field according to the viewer's role (`CategoryResponse.created_by_id`, `TodoResponse.owner_id`, `UserResponse.is_admin`/`is_active` are visible to anyone who can see the resource). A resource is either accessible and returned whole, or it is a 401/403/404.

### Category cache

Only categories are cached: they are shared, read by everyone, and rarely written. Todos are per-user and are not cached. All of it lives in `CategoryService`; the repository knows nothing about Redis.

```
category:<id>                            → CategoryResponse JSON               (TTL 8h)
categories:list:<gen>:<md5(skip,limit)>  → {"categories": [...], "total": n}   (TTL 8h)
categories:list:gen                      → integer generation counter          (no TTL)
```

- **A `name` search is never cached**, read or written — each distinct search term would otherwise mint its own cache entry forever, with no bound on how many. `skip` also has an upper bound for the same reason.
- **List invalidation is by generation.** A list can be cached under any combination of `skip`/`limit`, so instead of finding and deleting those keys, every create/update/delete does `INCR categories:list:gen`. Old entries become unreachable and expire on their own.
- **Item invalidation** is a `DEL category:<id>` on update and delete.
- **The cache tolerates a Redis outage.** Every cache read, write and invalidation catches `RedisError` (and, on reads, an unparsable payload), logs a warning (`redis_unavailable` / `cache_corrupted`) and falls back to the database. A cache problem must never turn into a 5xx. The general rate limit does the same (see "Rate limiting"); the refresh-token store and the login/sensitive-action limits have no fallback.
- `get_category_or_404` is the **uncached** read. Use it for anything that then mutates the row or needs an ORM instance (`update_category`, `delete_category`, the existence check of `GET /categories/{id}/todos`); only `GET /categories/{id}` uses `get_category_cached`.

### Cross-module relationships

`todos` and `categories` are many-to-many through `src/modules/todos_categories/`, a plain association `Table` with two `ON DELETE CASCADE` FKs (which only matter for a hard delete — see "Soft deletes"). `todos/models.py` and `categories/models.py` import each other's class only under `TYPE_CHECKING`; the `todos_categories` table is imported normally by both, which is safe because it references `"todos.id"`/`"categories.id"` as strings and imports neither class.

Dependencies between the two modules point one way, `categories → todos` at the router level and `todos → categories` at the schema level, never both for the same layer:

- `todos/schemas.py` imports `CategoryResponse` to build `TodoDetailResponse` (`GET /todos/{id}?include=categories`).
- The reverse is **not** a nested schema, which would make the schema import circular. A category's todos are a separate endpoint, `GET /categories/{id}/todos` → `PaginatedResponse[TodoResponse]`.
- That endpoint is a router depending on another module's *service*: `categories/router.py` imports `TodoServiceDep` and delegates to `TodoService.list_todos(category_ids=[category_id], ...)` instead of re-implementing pagination and ownership filtering. It calls `get_category_or_404` first only to return a real 404 for a missing category, where the todo query alone would return an empty page.

So `categories/schemas.py` must never import from `todos/schemas.py`, and `todos/router.py` must never import from `categories/router.py`.

### Optional includes and pagination

`GET /todos/{id}` takes an `include` query param and declares `response_model=TodoResponse | TodoDetailResponse`; the handler builds the right one explicitly with `.model_validate(...)`, since FastAPI can't choose a union member itself. The repository method takes a matching `with_<relation>: bool = False` flag that adds a `selectinload`.

List endpoints return `PaginatedResponse[T]`: the service returns `(items, total)` and the router builds the envelope. Their `limit` is typed `LimitQuery` (`src/core/schemas.py`): only 10, 25, 50 or 100 are accepted, default 25. A new list endpoint must use `LimitQuery` rather than its own `ge`/`le` bounds. Multi-value filters on a many-to-many field (`category_ids`) use OR semantics, and `category_ids` is capped at 20 IDs. Free-text filters use `ilike` with `Query(min_length=2)` so a one-character search can't match everything, and escape `%`/`_` (`BaseRepository.escape_ilike_value`) so a literal one in the search term isn't read as a SQL wildcard.

### Rate limiting

Three independent limits, all fixed-window counters in Redis (`INCR`, with the TTL set when the counter is created), all answering 429. Thresholds and windows are settings (`*_RATE_LIMIT_*` in `config.py` and `.env.example`).

| Limit | Where | Counted per | What counts |
|---|---|---|---|
| **General** | `rate_limit` middleware in `main.py` | user ID from a valid access token, else client IP | every request except `GET /health` |
| **Login** | `POST /login` | client IP **and** email, separately — either one blocks | failed logins only |
| **Sensitive actions** | `PATCH /users/me/email` and `/me/password` | user, one counter shared by both routes | wrong current password only |

- **The login and sensitive-action limits live in the router, not the service.** A dependency (`RateLimitLoginDep`, `SensitiveActionRateLimitDep`) checks the counter before the handler runs; the handler catches the service's exception (`UnauthorizedError` / `ForbiddenError`), increments, and re-raises. Services stay unaware of rate limiting. A new limited action follows the same shape.
- **Only failures count** on login and sensitive actions, so a legitimate user isn't throttled by succeeding. A successful login does **not** reset the login counters.
- **The general limit is a middleware**, because it covers every route. It reads the user ID straight from the JWT signature, with no database call; an invalid or expired token falls back to the IP instead of failing. It returns its 429 as a `JSONResponse` itself rather than raising `TooManyRequestsError`.
- **The general limit fails open.** If Redis raises, the middleware logs `redis_unavailable` and lets the request through uncounted, instead of turning every request into a 500 — a deliberate choice, not a gap to close.
- **`GET /health` is never counted**, so a monitoring probe can neither consume a quota nor get a 429.
- **`log_requests` must stay declared after `rate_limit` in `main.py`**, so that a 429 from the general limit is still logged and still carries `X-Request-ID`. `test_blocked_request_still_carries_request_id` checks it.

### Logging and request IDs

`structlog` renders JSON. The `log_requests` middleware in `main.py` clears the context vars, binds a `request_id`, logs one `request_completed` event per request, and echoes the ID in the `X-Request-ID` response header. An incoming `X-Request-ID` is reused only if it is at most 64 characters, otherwise a UUID is generated. Any `structlog.get_logger()` call made during a request inherits the `request_id` automatically — don't pass it around by hand.

## Known limitations

Accepted for now; don't "fix" them as a side effect of other work, and don't describe the system as if they were solved.

- **Cache invalidation runs before the commit.** `_invalidate_cache` is called inside the service, but the transaction commits when `get_db_session` exits. A concurrent read in that window can re-cache the pre-update row for up to 8 hours.
- **Request logs are off outside debug.** The log level is `DEBUG` when `settings.DEBUG` is true and `WARNING` otherwise, so `request_completed` (info) is only emitted in debug mode.
- **Logout does not revoke the access token.** It stays valid until it expires (5 minutes at most).
- **The published image is a dev image.** The `Dockerfile` starts uvicorn with `--reload` and runs as root, and that is what CI pushes to GHCR.
- **Registered emails can be enumerated through registration.** `POST /users` answers `409` for an email that is already taken. `/login` no longer leaks this (same message, same timing), but the 409 itself does: closing it means answering identically whether or not the email exists and confirming by email.
- **The last-admin guard is not atomic.** `set_user_active`/`set_user_admin` count the active admins, then write. Two admins demoting or deactivating each other at the same instant both pass the check and leave no admin.
