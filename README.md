# Todo API

[![CI](https://github.com/JrSaban/python-agentic-lab/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/JrSaban/python-agentic-lab/actions/workflows/ci.yml)

A REST API for managing todos and categories, built with **FastAPI** and **Clean Architecture** in Python. Built as a hands-on way to learn Python, FastAPI and SQLAlchemy, coming from a PHP/Laravel background — every module was written and tested from scratch, including JWT authentication with rotating refresh tokens, ownership-based authorization, a Redis cache, and a generic repository layer using Python 3.12's native generics.

## Tech stack

- **Python 3.12** · [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management
- **FastAPI** — async web framework, automatic OpenAPI docs
- **SQLAlchemy 2.0** (async) + **Alembic** — ORM and migrations
- **PostgreSQL** · **Redis** (cache, refresh tokens, rate-limit counters, idempotency keys, job queue)
- **Taskiq** — async background jobs and scheduling (worker + scheduler processes)
- **Pydantic v2** — request/response validation and serialization
- **argon2-cffi** — password hashing · **PyJWT** — access tokens
- **structlog** — JSON logs with a request ID on every line
- **pytest** + **httpx** — unit and integration tests, on in-memory SQLite and `fakeredis`
- **Ruff** — linting and formatting
- **Docker Compose** · **GitHub Actions**

## Features

- **Authentication** — registration, login, short-lived JWT access tokens, and opaque refresh tokens that are rotated on every use and revoked on logout
- **Role-based access control** — regular users vs. admins, with dedicated endpoints to promote/demote or (de)activate accounts (protected against locking out the last remaining admin)
- **Ownership & permissions** — a todo is private to its owner (admins see everything); a category is visible to everyone but only its creator or an admin can edit it, and only an admin can delete it
- **Todos ↔ Categories** — many-to-many relationship, with optional eager-loading (`?include=categories`) and filtering by category
- **Pagination & filtering** — every list endpoint supports `skip`/`limit` (page sizes of 10, 25, 50 or 100), free-text search, and resource-specific filters (status, category, role, ...)
- **Soft deletes** on todos and categories — a deleted row stays in the database but is invisible to the API, like Laravel's `SoftDeletes`, and is deleted for good by a weekly background job after 30 days, like Laravel's `Prunable`
- **Rate limiting** — a general per-user / per-IP request quota, plus stricter limits on failed logins and on wrong-password attempts when changing your email or password
- **Idempotency keys** — an optional `Idempotency-Key` header on `POST /todos` and `POST /categories`, so a retried request returns the original response instead of creating a duplicate
- **Redis caching** on category reads, invalidated on every write
- **Structured logging** — one JSON line per request, correlated by an `X-Request-ID` header
- **Alembic migrations**, including a 3-step pattern (add nullable → backfill → enforce `NOT NULL`) for introducing foreign keys on already-populated tables

## Design highlights

A few decisions worth a second look if you're skimming the code:

- **Ownership lives in the query, not as an afterthought.** `TodoRepository` takes an `owner_id: int | None` filter; the service computes it as `current_user.id`, or `None` for admins to disable the filter entirely. Requesting someone else's todo returns `404`, never `403` — the row simply doesn't match the filter, so the API never confirms whether an ID belongs to another user.
- **Uniqueness is enforced by the database, not by a check-then-insert.** Category names, emails and pseudos are unique case-insensitively through functional unique indexes (`lower(name)`). Services don't query first: they insert, catch the `IntegrityError`, and return a clean `409` — so two concurrent requests can't both slip through. A dedicated test runs the two inserts concurrently to prove it. The category index is partial (`WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`), so the name of a soft-deleted category can be reused.
- **Refresh tokens are stored hashed and rotated atomically.** Redis only holds the SHA-256 of a token, never the token itself. Each `/refresh` consumes it with a single `GETDEL`, so the same token can't be exchanged twice, even by two requests arriving at the same time. Rotation alone would let an active session renew itself forever, so a separate, longer-lived marker caps the session's absolute lifetime regardless of activity. Changing your password or your email revokes it outright, the same way logging out does.
- **Login takes the same time whether the email exists or not.** An unknown email still runs a full Argon2 verification, against a dummy hash computed once at startup, instead of short-circuiting — otherwise the response time alone would reveal which emails are registered, even behind an identical error message.
- **Rate limits that only punish failures.** Login attempts are counted per IP *and* per email, so neither rotating emails from one machine nor spreading guesses across machines gets around the limit — and only failed attempts count, so a legitimate user is never throttled for logging in. The services know nothing about it: limits are checked and counted at the router level.
- **Retries that can't create duplicates, even concurrent ones.** A client that times out and retries is the classic duplicate-maker — and the retry usually arrives while the first request is still running. The idempotency key is therefore claimed atomically in Redis (`SET NX`) *before* the request runs, so a concurrent retry gets a `409` instead of running twice. Only successful responses are stored, and only once the database transaction has actually committed.
- **A cache that never takes the API down.** Paginated category lists are invalidated with a generation counter (one `INCR` instead of hunting for every cached page). Every Redis call on the cache path is allowed to fail: the request falls back to PostgreSQL and logs a warning.
- **Generic repository layer.** `BaseRepository[ModelT: Base]` (`src/core/repository.py`) uses Python 3.12's native generic syntax (`class Foo[T]`) to share pagination, counting and typed filtering across `Todo`, `Category` and `User` repositories, while each resource keeps its own fully-typed filter parameters — no dynamic/untyped filter dicts.
- **Clean Architecture, enforced consistently.** Every module follows the same `router → service → repository → models` layering; services raise framework-agnostic exceptions (`NotFoundError`, `ForbiddenError`, ...) mapped to HTTP status codes in one place, never `HTTPException` scattered through the business logic.
- **Tested at two levels.** Fast unit tests exercise each service in isolation with mocked repositories; integration tests run the full FastAPI stack against a real (in-memory) database. CI also applies every migration to a real PostgreSQL instance.

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JrSaban/python-agentic-lab.git
cd python-agentic-lab
cp .env.example .env
```

Set a real `JWT_SECRET_KEY` in `.env` — the app refuses to start with the placeholder, or with anything shorter than 32 bytes:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

Then start everything:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build                          # API on :8000, Postgres on :5432, Redis on :6379, job worker + scheduler
docker compose exec api uv run alembic upgrade head   # create the tables
```

Interactive API docs (Swagger UI) are available at [http://localhost:8000/docs](http://localhost:8000/docs) when `DEBUG=True`, as in `.env.example`. They are off by default.

<summary>Running the API on the host</summary>

```bash
docker compose up -d db redis
uv sync
uv run alembic upgrade head
uv run uvicorn src.main:app --reload
uv run taskiq worker src.core.broker:broker --fs-discover        # background jobs, in another terminal
uv run taskiq scheduler src.core.broker:scheduler --fs-discover  # scheduled jobs (one instance only)
```

</details>

## Running the tests

No Postgres or Redis needed — the suite runs on in-memory SQLite and `fakeredis`.

```bash
uv run pytest              # full suite
uv run ruff check .        # lint
uv run ruff format .       # format
```
